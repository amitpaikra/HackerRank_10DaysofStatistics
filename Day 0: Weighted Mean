Task
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array,W, representing the respective weights of X's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of X's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3  format).

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
N = int(input())
X = list(map(int , input().split()))
W = list(map(int , input().split()))

summ = 0 
sw = 0
for i in range(N):
    summ += X[i]*W[i]
    sw += W[i]

ans = summ/sw
print(round(ans , 1))
